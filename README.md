## What is Kubernetes

## Terminology Reference


## Runtime

Kubernetes will run on a number of Container Runtimes which implement
the _Container Runtime Interface_ (CRI). The two most well known are:

* containerd
* CRI-O

The containerd CRI is actually already installed if you have Docker
installed, as Docker Engine also makes use of containerd.

## Setup & Install

Kubernetes requires a CRI available, as noted above. We can use `containerd`
for this purpose. On Ubuntu, this can be installed via:
```
apt install -y containerd
```

### Disable Swap
While modern K8s does have some support for swap memory, older versions would
not work at all with any swap space. To avoid issue, you can disable swap
entirely.
```
swapoff -a
# Then comment out swap mounts from /etc/fstab
```

### Setup Networking
Kubernetes requires additional networking modules enabled
and must be allowed to forward traffic.

```
# Enable modules by default on startup
tee /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf <<EOF
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

# Probe modules for current boot
modprobe overlay
modprobe br_netfilter

# Enable kernel parameteres
tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf <<EOF
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

# Restart sysctl to read in new parameters
systemctl restart systemd-sysctl
```

Tools you will need include:
* `kubeadm`: To provision and build your cluster.
* `kubectl`: To issue commands to your cluster.
* `kubelet`: The component on each cluster node which manages that specific node.

### Debian Install

Add the signing key need for the package repository.
```
curl -fsSL https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add the package repository (Note the `xenial` despite that Ubuntu distro being long expired. Way-to-go, Google.)
```
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

Then install the required packages.
```
apt update
apt install kubeadm kubectl kubelet
```

### Snap Install

All three tools can be installed using `snap` on Ubuntu:
```
snap install --classic kubeadm
snap install --classic kubectl
snap install --classic kubelet
```

Note, my limited testing with snap these packages resulted in a sub-optimal experience.

### Manual Install

Installation can also be done independently. Instructions are available on:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/


## Initialize the Cluster
If everything else is ready, you can create a new cluster by
initializing a master node. On the master node, run the
`kube init` command.

There are many customizations you can set when creating your cluster,
so you may want to refer to the `kubeadm init` [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/).
To see what the default values are for any given config option, run:
```
kubeadm config print init-defaults
```

Here is an example command to create a cluster:
```sh
kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint=kube1.test.lib.msu.edu \
             # IP address to say API server is listening on
             --apiserver-advertise-address 35.8.223.999 \
             # CIDR address range to use
             --pod-network-cidr 10.244.0.0/16
```

This will precheck and ensure your node is configured correctly
before proceeding. If your node isn't ready, it will display
errors indicating what you still need to do, but it won't fix
the problems. That's up to you!

## Networking

Kubernetes doesn't prescribe a set of networking tools to use either, rather
if uses the _Container Network Interface_ (CNI) to to setup virtual
ethenet devices, routes, assigning IPs, etc. CNI is used by Kubernetes,
but also other solutions, such as Podman, rkt, and Mesos.

Why so many options? Well, why do we need Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, and
the rest? Open source mean you have options!

Popular options for networking are listed below:

### Flannel
Flannel is a simple to setup networking option which works well for
many use cases.

* https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel

### Calico
Considered a more flexible and advanced option for networking, claiming
to be a performance option.

* https://github.com/projectcalico/calico

### Cillium
Designed to handle large and complex networks more efficiently.

* https://github.com/cilium/cilium

### Some Additional Options
More networking solutions for those interested in researching them.

* Weave Net: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave
* Antrea: https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea
* Kube-router: https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router
* Kube-OVN: https://github.com/kubeovn/kube-ovn

For an even more extensive list, check out the readme on the
[CNI GitHub page](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni).

Note that when using a cloud networking provider, you may not have
any choice in what your networking option will be.
